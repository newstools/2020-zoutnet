News - Date: 10 January 2020 Written by: Tshifhiwa Mukwevho / Viewed: 397 A 62-year old lady, Sophie Maringa Kubayi, and her two sons, Musa Loverboy Hlungwani (43) and Sergie Hlungwani (35) appeared in the Tiyani District Court on a murder charge on Tuesday. The three were arrested in connection with the killing of Mrs Kubayi’s husband at Tiyani village on 31 December. The suspects had allegedly accused Kubayi of practicing witchcraft. An argument started at about 08:00 on that day, after which the victim was apparently strangled to death inside one of the rooms. One of the sons allegedly complained that his father had bewitched him, as every time he married a woman, she would not stay long. The police reacted to a report about the incident and, on arrival at the scene, the deceased was found with bruises, lying motionless in one of the rooms. The provincial commissioner of Limpopo, Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba, has condemned this incident and has warned community members to desist from accusing other people of practicing witchcraft and then killing them. The three will appear in court again on 6 February. They all remain in custody.
