News - Date: 17 January 2020 Written by: Kaizer Nengovhela / Viewed: 1128 Mr Terrence Kuaho (38), the head of the youth section at Makhado Municipality, was described as a loving, friendly and hardworking individual whose contribution to the development of his community would remain forever. Kuaho died in the Netcare Hospital in Polokwane a fortnight ago and he was buried at Vleifontein on Saturday. When addressing family, municipal employees and friends of the deceased, Cllr John Mamafha said losing an employee of Kuaho’s calibre was sad. “His departure is a great loss to both the family, the community and us as his employers.” Mamafha said employees who worked in the parks were a very important part of the municipality. Mr Peter Muthambi, one of Kuaho’s colleagues, said that he was shattered by his friend’s passing. “We were so close that I don’t even know how the workplace will be without him. He left us so soon while we still needed him. We will miss his jokes, sense of humour and smiling face.” Family representative Mr Elvis Ramalwa thanked the municipality for their support during the difficult time. “Although we are mourning, we are thankful for your support during this time. We have seen you assisting the family from the first day our loved one passed on. This clearly demonstrates that you are full of love, care and responsibility.”  Relatives and friends carry the coffin to the graveyard.
