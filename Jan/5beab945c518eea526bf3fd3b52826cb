A renowned choir master, Mabyalane was also a councillor for the Messina Town Council before 1994. The mayor of Musina, Cllr Mihloti Muhlope, sent condolences to the family of the well-known academic and community builder who recently passed on. Muhlope said that, despite being in mourning, the people of Musina and beyond should celebrate the life of the deceased, who had been an inspiration to both young and old. “As government, we are deeply touched by the passing of this great man. His skills as a renowned educator have added very great value to what Musina is today. It is educators like him who brought light to many of us who are professionals today. Indeed, we are deeply touched by his departure here on earth.” She said Mabyalane’s life had been well lived and was worth celebrating. “He may be gone but his contributions will never be forgotten. We thank God for giving us this wonderful gift in him. His spirit will continue to guide us in our community-building initiatives, and we shall live with his legacy forever.” Ms Juliana Chirwa said her uncle had been a pillar of strength, a motivator and a community builder in his own right. “His departure is a terrible loss to the family because we regarded him as a family cornerstone. As a very wise man, we depended on him for advice and we will always remember his wisdom and love of education.” She said although the family was mourning, the support from friends, community members and various stakeholders was well received by the mourners. “This clearly demonstrates that my uncle was a people’s person. We are very grateful to have had someone of his calibre in our family. His wisdom will live with us forever.”  Mr Jacob Maurice Mabyalane.  Email:
