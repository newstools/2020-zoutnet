We want everyone guilty to face the might of the law and as I am speaking now, the Special Investigation Unit is within the institution and some of our implicated employees have already resigned working with us,” said Nenguda. Nenguda was speaking during a media briefing that was recently held in the mayoral board room, aimed at outlining his plans for the district municipality since he was appointed in his position in May last year. He said as the district, they were a water services authority and they had established a rapid response team (RRT) to deal with the water challenges affecting the communities. “We understand that some of our water pipes are old and we have plans to replace the ageing infrastructure. We urged communities to stop vandalizing water pipes and to stop illegal connection of water pipes,” he added. Nenguda further said that the communities in Xihosana had been without water for the past 10 years and through his intervention, they now had water.  Cllr Dowelani Nenguda.  Email:
