News - Date: 27 February 2020 Written by: Kaizer Nengovhela / Viewed: 248 The total shutdown by residents of Gogobole and Tshiozwi who were blocking roads using stones and all sorts of rubble last week was called off after the three suspects who were arrested for alleged arson were released. The three had been arrested in connection with the burning of five houses and two cars at Gogobole and Tshiozwi three weeks ago. They were released last Thursday. Thousands of commuters were left stranded, many workers did not report for work and school children were forced to stay at home because of the barricaded roads and the lack of transport. Shops in the area were closed for most of the mornings. Angry members of the community even broke down a bus shelter and placed it in the road for three days. The unrest also followed the ongoing problem of housebreaking and theft in the Sinthumule area, with residents seemingly deciding to take the law into their own hands. The two who were released without bail are Innocent Bakali and Azwihangwisi Mugwedi. Ambani Ramala was remanded in custody for another two assault-to-cause-grievous-bodily-harm cases. He appeared on Monday and his cases were withdrawn. The three will appear again in the arson case in March.  Generic image.
