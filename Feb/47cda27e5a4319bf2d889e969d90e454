A resident at Ribungwani village near Giyani, the accused had raped a 14-year-old girl in 2014 and another girl (17) in 2016. These incidents were reported to the police and the cases were then assigned to D/Const Conny Mabunda, attached to the SAPS's Giyani Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit. She started with investigations that led to the arrest of the accused and his subsequent sentencing. The South African Police Service's provincial commissioner, Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba, welcomed the sentence on both charges and commended the investigating officer, who had worked tirelessly to ensure that "the criminal was removed from society for a long time".  D/Const Conny Mabunda worked tirelessly to ensure that investigations bore the desired results. Picture: SAPS.
