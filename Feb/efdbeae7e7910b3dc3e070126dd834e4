News - Date: 20 February 2020 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 1061 Hundreds of people from all corners of Vuwani gathered at the Tshino Mighty Sports Grounds a fortnight ago to witness the installation of a new senior traditional leader for the Nesengani tribe, Thovhele Ndivheni Nesengani. Traditional dances such as tshikona were the order of the day. It also rained, which Vhavenda people believe is a sign of his acceptance by the ancestors to lead the people. During the ceremony, called the U dadziwa ha mativha or installation ceremony, Thovhele Toni Mphephu Ramabulana, who conducted the installation, said a tribe without a senior leader was doomed. “You have to treat your communities with respect, because you are a senior leader with some chiefs and communities under you. You have to understand that there could be family squabbles about who should lead, but I’m happy that the new senior traditional leader, whom I named Nndivheni, was accepted by the makhadzi and makhotsimunene (royal family),” said Mphephu. Mphephu advised the gathering of people that they must allow the Nesengani tribe to deal with issues of the chieftaincy alone and warned that whoever tried to cause division would be dealt with. He urged the communities to support the new senior traditional leader, so that the delivery of services could reach even the poorest communities without delay or favour.
