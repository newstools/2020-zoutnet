News - Date: 10 May 2020 Written by:  / Viewed: 282 By Charity Mulaudzi While many small business enterprises are battling to come to grips with the effects of the Covid-19 lockdown, some are using the time to try and make a difference to their communities. One such case is at Ravele Village, where a local seamstress is producing face masks that she distributes free of charge to the elderly and vulnerable people. Ms Dorin Mashudu Mudau decided to use her talent as a dressmaker to help people who cannot afford to buy face masks. She said she started making dresses about six years ago, mainly catering for special functions and school uniforms. With the lockdown period in place, she decided to use her talent and skills on other projects. “I have seen on social media that people are selling protective masks for personal gain,” she said. She realised that no-one seemed to care for the vulnerable in the communities. Mudau then started making face masks, which she distributed among the elderly people in the Sinthumule and Kutama areas. “I am prioritizing the homeless people, the elderly and other vulnerable people or groups who are most impacted by the pandemic,” she said. Mudau believes everyone has the right to protect their health. Her biggest challenge at this stage is to find oil for her sewing machines. “The places where they sell oil for sewing machines are still closed because of this pandemic,” she explained. Anyone who can assist with sewing machine oil or even those who wish to donate cloth that can be used to make masks can contact Ms Mudau at 072 2061740 or 072 0353991.
