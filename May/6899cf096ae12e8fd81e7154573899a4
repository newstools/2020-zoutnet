News - Date: 28 May 2020 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 837 The prosecutor accused of corruption and defeating the ends of justice, Ratshilumela Leonard Makhado (48), was granted R5 000 bail by the Thohoyandou Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. The magistrate from Tzaneen, Mr David Shikwambane, who was called as neutral officer because he does not work in Thohoyandou, also postponed the case to 13 July for further police investigation. When granting the bail, Shikwambane told Makhado that he must not interfere with the witnesses and warned him that he would forfeit the bail money if he did not comply with the order. His legal representative, Mr Goddard Mugwena, a practicing candidate attorney for AR Madia attorneys, said that he was happy that his client had been given bail as this was his constitutional right. Makhado is accused of taking a bribe of R6 000 from an accused in a reckless-driving case, after he had allegedly told the accused that he could squash the case. Limpopo Hawks spokesperson Captain Maluleke said, "the money was meant to make the case disappear," and the alleged kickback was reported to the Hawks. A sting operation was initiated, which culminated in the prosecutor’s arrest soon after accepting the money.  Accused of corruption and defeating the ends of justice, prosecutor Ratshilumela Makhado is out on bail of R5 000.  Email:
