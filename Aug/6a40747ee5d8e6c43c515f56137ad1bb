As individuals, we should tap into our passion, and one day we will earn a living from it,” said Fhatuwani Mulaudzi, who turned a fireplace into a recording studio. Mulaudzi’s studio is just a few kilometres away from Elim, in Mapfeni Block D1 and is made of mud and poles, and the corrugated zinc sheets on the roof are kept in place by stones. When asked about what inspired his creativity, Mulaudzi said, “I have always been in love with music. My uncle, Xilabg, is a musician and I thought of following his lifestyle, hoping that I could earn a living that is better than what I am currently doing.” Mulaudzi is not employed and he does some upholstery work to keep things going. He admits, however, that making a living from piece jobs is difficult. His studio is a small room that can barely accommodate more than four people. A computer attached to several music instruments takes up most of the space. As Mulaudzi has noticed a growing number of musicians in need of a studio, he has now started building a brick studio from the little money he manages to put away. He has one child and his wife is not employed. “When I am done for the day, I have to disconnect my instruments and take them to a safe place,” said Mulaudzi. When opening and closing the door, one must be extra careful, lest the door fall on your back. Mulaudzi has released several albums, varying between Afro pop, rhumba, and jazz. He is currently working on another video, which he expects will take his audience by surprise. Mulaudzi can be contacted on 076 097 2624.  Fhatuwani Mulaudzi in his "mud-house" studio.
