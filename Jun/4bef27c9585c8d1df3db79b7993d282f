News - Date: 05 June 2020 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 1967 Well-known comedian Livhuwani Madadzhe (31), better known as Captain SABC Livhu, is accusing a former friend of his of assault and theft. The case is scheduled to appear in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on June 24. Madadzhe has laid charges against Muvenda Ndou, the publisher and editor of the tabloid-style local newspaper, The Opinion. He alleges that Ndou stormed into his office in Thohoyandou and, without any provocation, started to assault him. “He grabbed me on the back of my arms … bit me and smashed my cellphone during the struggle,” said Madadzhe. He further alleges that Ndou then took R5 000 that was meant to purchase stock for his business. Friction between Madadzhe and Ndou seems to have existed for some time. Madadzhe said that he and Ndou had regularly exchanged ideas in the past. In March this year, Ndou allegedly made some negative comments on Captain SABC Livhu’s Facebook page. The comments allegedly implied that Madadzhe made fun of people who were addicted to drugs without really trying to help them rehabilitate. Madadzhe disputed this and said that he went out of his way to try and assist people who battled with drug addiction. In one case, he arranged with a doctor to assist a young and talented artist who battled with addiction. He said the attack left him feeling humiliated. “Since that day, I don’t want to be associated with him (Ndou) anymore. I reported the matter to the police because I am a peace-loving person. I don’t want to involve myself in fighting with people,” he added. Efforts to get comment from Muvenda Ndou about the matter were unsuccessful. He told Limpopo Mirror that he did not want to comment at this stage. He said this was a very sensitive issue, but the true facts would come out in court.
