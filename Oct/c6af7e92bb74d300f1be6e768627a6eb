News - Date: 23 October 2020 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 548 Khosikhulu Vho-Toni Mphephu Ramabulana has issued a strong warning to communities in Ha-Musekwa and surrounding areas such as Maranikhwe, Maangani and Pfumembe in Nzhelele to refrain from vandalizing the newly opened Musekwa Rural Access Road. “We are witnessing the good news of the opening of the new road, which will go a long way in helping our communities, but I urge people not to vandalise the road even when they are worried about poor service delivery,” said Ramabulana. Ramabulana said the three-kilometre-long Musekwa Rural Access Road had improved conditions for local communities. He also appealed to the government to fast-track Phase 2 of the road construction, so that buses and taxis could ferry their commuters smoothly. He was joined by several traditional leaders when he addressed the communities of Ha-Musekwa. Ramabulana also appealed to the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) to speed up the delivery of water to the affected communities of Ha-Musekwa and surrounding villages. He said that the communities should understand that government had a long backlog in terms of delivery of better access roads, especially in the rural communities, but they had to handle the issue with care. “As traditional leaders, we are the custodians of the communities and we cannot be happy if our communities are not getting better services. In Tshivenda, we can say “Vhathundimapfura, vhaadoliwa, meaning people or communities should be treated with respect, because they are human beings,” said Ramabulana.
