News - Date: 06 March 2020 Written by: Silas Nduvheni / Viewed: 472 Premier Stan Mathabatha will launch the Vhembe District Development Model at the Makhuvha Stadium on Friday. Limpopo government spokesperson Mr Phuthi Seloba said the launch of the district development model in Vhembe followed the official launch of the development model in Limpopo Province by Pres Cyril Ramaphosa last November in the Waterberg District, and Mathabatha launched the model in the Capricorn District early in February. According to Seloba, Mathabatha made the commitment to launch the district development model to ensure that the province’s five districts have one plan and one budget to promote service delivery to the people. In the recent State of the Province Address (SOPA), Mathabatha said "that the government has managed to place the province which is rural on a pedestal for a higher growth trajectory". He added that it is within this context, "that we are implementing some of the major catalytic projects, which (are) aimed at stimulating economic growth and job creation. These include the Musina-Makhado Special Economic Zone (SEZ), the proposed Tubatse SEZ, the revitalization of the industrial parks, agricultural and several mining initiatives and with the additional investment commitment of 6.1 billion US dollars, the number of projected jobs to be created by (the) Musina-Makhado SEZ project has since been revised upward from (an) initial 21 000 to 26 000 jobs”. Seloba further said that the Vhembe District Municipality was known as the fruit basket of the province and the home of the Makhado-Musina SEZ and that agriculture was one of the identified pillars for growing the economy of the province and that of Vhembe District. Vhembe has the Nwanedi Agri-Hub based in Musina, which serves more than 200 rural farmers who are packaging and sending their agricultural products to the South African market and the rest of the world.
